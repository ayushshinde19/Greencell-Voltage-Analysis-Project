# Greencell-Voltage-Analysis-Project
Python implementation for connected vehicles data analysis of battery voltage for a GreenCell internship assignment
# ⚡ GreenCell Internship Project: Connected Vehicle Battery Voltage Analysis

## 🎯 Project Goal

This repository contains the solution to the **GreenCell Internship Assignment in Connected Vehicles and Data Analysis**.

The objective of this project was to analyze time-series data related to electric bus battery voltage, implement data transformation techniques, visualize trends, and extract critical insights on battery health and performance cycles.

## ✨ Key Features & Analysis Steps

The project fulfills all requirements of the assignment:

1.  **Data Import & Preparation:** Loaded raw voltage and timestamp data from the provided CSV file.
2.  **Moving Average Calculation:** Computed both **1000-point** and **5000-point** moving averages on the voltage data to smooth out noise and reveal longer-term trends.
3.  **Data Visualization:** Generated a comprehensive plot showing the **Original Voltage**, **1000 MA**, and **5000 MA** over time.
4.  **Critical Event Detection:** Identified **Peak** (High) and **Low** (Valley) voltage events, as well as any instances where the voltage dropped below the critical threshold of **20V**.
5.  **Bonus Feature (Downward Acceleration):** Included an implementation to calculate **downward acceleration** based on voltage trends, providing an additional layer of domain-specific insight.
6.  **Dashboard Generation:** Produced a final Excel-based summary dashboard containing key statistics and event logs.

## 📊 Summary of Key Results

The analysis of the voltage data (spanning from **2024-06-26** to **2024-07-03**) revealed the following key metrics and observations:

| Metric | Value | Observation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Data Points** | `21919` | Robust dataset for time-series analysis. |
| **Average Voltage** | `67.33V` | The mean operational voltage during the period. |
| **Maximum Voltage** | `100.00V` | The highest recorded voltage. |
| **Minimum Voltage** | `25.00V` | The lowest recorded voltage. |
| **Critical Voltage Check** | **GOOD** | No instances of voltage dropping below the critical 20V threshold were detected. |
| **Key Low Event** | `41.64V` at `2024-06-26 19:15:40` | One of the lowest recorded voltage events, potentially indicating a discharge cycle. |
